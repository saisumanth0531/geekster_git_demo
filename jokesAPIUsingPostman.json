    "value": "Chuck Norris was once challenged to a game of chess by a chess master! A couple of hours into the game, the chess master moved his queen to b7, putting Chuck Norris into check mate! However, Chuck Norris moved his fist into the chess master's face and moved his foot into the chess master's ass, thereby winning the game of chess forever!"
